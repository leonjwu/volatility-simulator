# Volatility Surface Explorer

The volatility surface explorer is a high-performance [webapp](http://vol-app-prod.herokuapp.com/) I created for exploratory data analysis of implied volatility surfaces. You can view historical surface dynamics in high resolution (up to 10 second intervals) through animations.

Load up a preset within the app to explore interesting surface dynamics during times of low liquidity such as expiring options, 

Created in Plotly Dash (Python), CSS and HTML. 


The volatility surface simulator is an interval backtesting tool I created to backtest and benchmark my own improvements to the production stochastic volatilty model.
